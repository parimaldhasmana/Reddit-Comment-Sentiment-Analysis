# Reddit-Comment-Sentiment-Analysis

**INTRODUCTION**
Reddit is a link sharing, discussion, and community building platform. The main unit of content on reddit are “posts”, which can only be submitted by users with a reddit account. A “link post” consists of a title that links to any page on the web (including links to other pages on reddit). A “text post” consists of a title and body of text. Both link and text posts have a comments section where other users can discuss the post. Our goal is to analyse the comments for a post by understanding sentiment of comment. This can help us in understanding distribution of sentiments on comments across the subreddits

Using the Reddit API to perform Sentiment analysis and text classification
Using Natural Language Processing, we can identify how different subreddits have different types of critical words

**About the Dataset**
We used RedditExtractoR package to fetch data from reddit API using the search terms “virus” and “news”.
Filename: worldnews_test3.csv. The data contains comments on posts from various subreddits like worldnews, AskReddit, cemu, news, etc

**Inference** -
As is evident, January month dominates the number of posts.Its interesting to see the pattern i.e Number of posts is maintained ~950 for the months of February, April, May and June while for the rest of the months its ~500. This will be really useful from business perspective, as now companies knows that the first month of new year i.e January is the month for highest number of posts, hence companies can launch and advertise their products during this peak time.
